    <hr>
    <h1><u>Introduction</u></h1>
    <p><b>Amarican college </b>has been offering Bachelor of Science (BS) program in Computer Science since 2002. The
        prime focus of the program
        is to equip the students in the field of Computer Science so that they could grasp the in-built technicalities
        and complexities of computer and its related contemporary issues. The curriculum is based on the recommendations
        of the National Curriculum Revision Committees approved by the Higher Education Commission (HEC), Islamabad.
        However, the University may update the curricula from time to time with the approval of designated bodies.
        During the final year, students will be required to spend a good deal of time in completing a project. This
        project will usually be done in collaboration with industry, under the guidance of the professionals nominated
        by the University.</p>
