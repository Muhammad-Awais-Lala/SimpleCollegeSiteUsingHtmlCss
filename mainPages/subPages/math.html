    <hr>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics program is designed for those students who want to pursue their study in the
        field of Mathematics. Mathematics is a basic and powerful tool for solving problems and a highly creative field
        of study. Mathematics is important to all areas of our society and is a foundation for many different kinds of
        careers. Mathematical graduates are in high demand and can obtain well paid work in many areas, including
        teaching, investment banking and finance; the civil service; the pharmaceutical industry; and medicine
        statistics. Mathematics graduates are highly employable due to the advanced problem-solving, analytical skills
        and higher level numeracy skills developed by studying this subject.</p>

    <h3>The program will afford the students:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An opportunity to expand their knowledge in the field of mathematics and its applications by providing
            courses at graduate level</li>
        <li>Preparation for a professional career in education, or in business, industry and research institutions;
        </li>
        <li>To continue their studies in mathematics, comprehensive knowledge in mathematics and its applications, as
            well as an opportunity to decide whether they are willing to become mathematicians.
        </li>
    </ul>
