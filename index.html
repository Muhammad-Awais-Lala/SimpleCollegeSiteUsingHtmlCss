                    <p>I would like to share with you the short history of the college. The emergence of missionary
                        education spreading across the wider parts of erstwhile Madras Presidency at the end of 19th
                        century and start of the <b>20th century</b> saw education reaching the unreached spaces.</p>

                    <p>One such defining moment was the establishment of The American College in Madurai, started
                        initially as <i>Pasumalai College</i> at Pasumalai near Madurai. Established in <b>1881</b>,
                        under the
                        initiatives of G.T. Washburn, an American missionary, this institution of higher education is
                        known for its focus on academic excellence</p>
                    <p>College was shifted to its present location during the period of <b>W.M. Zumbro</b>, its second
                        Principal, who had his formal education at University of Michigan, Columbia, and Yale.He made a
                        proposal in the year 1903 to the Missionary Fund in the United States to shift the College to
                        Madurai. Verdant locale and imposing structures of heritage value are hallmarks of the present
                        campus of The American College.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>American College,a higher education known for its focus on academic excellence and social relevance. Its
                pioneering role in the development of College autonomy in India, its successful early implementation of
                Choice Based Credit System in 1978 and its completion of 135 years of servics bear testimony to the
                position
                that the college currently enjoys. Originally founded as a missionaries in 1841, The American College
                grew
                into a collegiate department in 1881 at Pasumalai by the initiatives taken by Rev.G.T.Washburn,the
                Founder-Principal of the college.In the year 1906,the college was shifted to the present campus during
                the
                time of the second Principal Rev.W.M.Zumbro.it became independent of the mission in 1934 when an
                autonomous
                Governing council was formed to manage it own affairs.Earlier,it was affiliated to the University of
                Madras
                and later,it came under the jurisdiction of Madurai Kamaraj University.</p>
            <p>
                With its extreme sensitivity to national policies and community needs, the college has grown from
                strength
                to strength. It was one of the first set of seven colleges to be made autonomous by the UGC in
                1977-1978.Today the college offers thirty undergraduate and sixteen post-graduate Programmes. There are
                seven research centres offering M.Phil., and Ph.D Programmes in various disciplines,and two autonomous
                centres like Department of Applied Sciences (DAS) and Study Centre for Indian Literature in English and
                Translation (SCILET) receiving national and international attention. Its alumni shine as luminaries
                internationally as scientists, intellectuals, administrators, corporate managers, statesman and leaders.
                The
                College has active theatre groups, National Service Scheme, N.C.C. units and service learning Programme
                (SLP) that offer students a wide variety of opportunities to serve society. These activities add up to
                make
                the campus a vibrant for developing one' s personality.</p>
